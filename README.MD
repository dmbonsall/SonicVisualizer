# Sonic Visualizer
This is a purly analog solution to the days old problem of "I want my RGB LEDs to flash pretty colors when my music plays." This design involves taking audio input and running it through a bank of bandpass filters before doing level detection and PWM convertion. The backend is a set of MOSFET driver circuits to push current through the LED's.
